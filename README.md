### Welcome. My name is Ryan Hawkins. I am a **software** engineer. 

#### _Software_ and _game development_ excite me, because they require a balance of logic and creativity. I am on the path to becoming a paid programmer for my second career. For the past 17+ years, I've been a correctional officer, and now I'm looking for something new and more fulfilling.
